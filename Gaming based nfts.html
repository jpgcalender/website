    <h2>What are Gaming NFTs?</h2>
    <p>Gaming NFTs are unique digital assets that are used in gaming to represent ownership of in-game items, characters, and other virtual assets. Unlike traditional in-game items that are stored on the game's servers, NFTs are stored on a blockchain, making them unique, secure, and easily transferable between players. </p>
    
    <h2>Examples of Gaming NFTs</h2>
    <p>Here are a few examples of games that use NFTs:</p>
